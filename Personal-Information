Hello Mam,

My name is Rahul Shah. I’m a UI developer with 9 years of experience. I have completed my graduation from HNGU. Also, I have completed a ReactJS course from TOPS technologies for career upgradation. I am from Siddhpur, Patan and currently living in Ahmedabad. There are 5 members in the family. Apart from that I like sports, traveling, and watching movies. 

I was always creative and able to put my creative ideas on paper, I decided to start my career as a web designer in the IT field. After gaining some experience in this field. currently, I have learned ReactJS to apply my creativity and development to give the best solutions.

That’s about me.

Thank you.
